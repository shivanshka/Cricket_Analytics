He has been at the centre of the side since their time in the ICC's World Cricket League Division Five, from where Afghanistan began their rise to the international stage."

He has followed the same tried and tested route to the national side as many of his generation that came after the initial Afghan cricketing pioneers, with age-group cricket preparing him for the big stage. His ODI debut, against Ireland in Dublin in 2012, was possibly a little premature but Zadran's batting turned a corner in 2014 and he started to look more at home. In July, his second-innings 99 helped Afghanistan beat a strong Zimbabwe A side in an unofficial Test, and in November his unbeaten 32-ball 60 helped set up a 54-run win over Pakistan A in a Twenty match. He started 2015 well with a maiden ODI fifty, a boundary-laden 83 against Ireland, and cruised into Afghanistan's World Cup squad.Liam Brickhill"

Firstly, that the game's formats had diverged so much that a man without a state contract or even a first-class appearance to his name could be worth such a sum; and secondly, that David had become one of the world's most sought-after T20 finishers over the previous 12 months."

Although he was only 23 at the time, the baggy green had felt a long time coming, given that Hazlewood had been highly regarded for so long. At 17, he had become the youngest fast bowler to be selected by New South Wales, and at 19 he was in his first one-day international against England at Southampton, joining Craig McDermott and Ray Bright as the only Australian 19-year-olds to play the format so soon. Hazlewood was initially chosen for Australia's Test tour of India in late 2010 but was withdrawn due to a back stress injury, and it was not until four years later that he finally played his first Test, having added significant strength to his 196cm frame."

It is not just his power that worries opposing bowlers and captains. His ability to make unconventional shots appear routine - reverse sweeps and pulls, for example - makes it hard to set fields to cover all of his scoring areas. His audacity comes with risk, and he can exasperate as well as exhilarate, but at his best he can change a game in moments."

A left-armer called Mitchell has been a staple of Australia's attack for more than a decade and seems set to remain so for the foreseeable future. While Johnson was more express, Starc is still quick enough to make life uncomfortable for opposition batsmen, especially with the bounce gained from his 1.96m height - and boasts greater control of swing than his former colleague. Never was that shown to greater effect than during the 2015 World Cup, when Starc was at times unplayable, his inswingers rattling stumps and trapping batsmen in front throughout the competition. Not surprisingly he was named Player of the Tournament for his 22 victims at 10.18, and four years later he would claim 27 wickets at the World Cup in England when Australia's defence ended in the semi-finals."

In T20, especially, he has proven a hard man to get away, with subtle changes of pace and variations, including a wrong'un and straight ball making up for a lack of prodigious turn. He's a (mullet-wearing) colourful character off the field, but in contrast, his bowling, focusing on control, is clinical."

A versatile and hard-hitting batter, he enjoyed a breakthrough Sheffield Shield season in 2020-21 with 585 runs including his first three first-class hundreds having previously churned out runs at grade level without quite making the step up. That followed consecutive 400-plus run seasons for Scorchers in the BBL - where his adaptability at moving from the top order to the middle was noted by selectors - and having continued to flay runs in county cricket for Leicestershire he was named in Australia's 2021 T20 World Cup despite not being part of any of the previous series.

He took a while to get going after that, although his T20I captain Mahmudullah praised his maturity during a tricky innings on a turning Mirpur pitch. In February 2022 in Chattogram, 22-year-old Afif rescued Bangladesh from 45 for 6 in a record stand with Mehidy Hasan Miraz against Afghanistan - they added an unbeaten 174, the second-highest partnership for the seventh wicket or lower in ODIs. Afif is also the youngest T20 debutant to take a five-for - he was 17 years and 72 days when he picked up 5 for 21, including the wicket of Chris Gayle, for Rajshahi Kings against Chittagong Vikings in December 2016."

On the slow pitches of the Caribbean, he changed his bowling style to left-arm spin and transformed into a spin-bowling allrounder, with help from  coach Ameer Akbar and team manager Haroon Rashid. "

Leask also bowls useful off-spin, taking three wickets in Scotland's win over Tasmania in their World Cup acclimatisation tour in autumn 2014.
Leask played a solitary first-class game for Northants in a tour match against New Zealand A in 2014. He moved on to Somerset ahead of the 2016 season with Somerset's director of cricket Matt Maynard describing him as a ""feisty cricketer"". A scattering of T20 matches were his only outings in his debut season.

Williams is as adept at the stroke as either of these two elder statesmen of Zimbabwean cricket, which he proved during the course of his maiden Test century against New Zealand in Bulawayo in July 2016. Equally astounding was his resolve to overcome sickness and high fever to battle on for over three hours during the course of that knock, in a game in which Zimbabwe were floundering."
